This program was extremely fun to program. The instructions were much clearer than previous assignments and less time was spent figuring out what the assignment wanted and more time thinking through and testing the code. The walkthrough also clearly broke up the approach of this assignment into understandable steps and I greatly enjoyed this assignment.
