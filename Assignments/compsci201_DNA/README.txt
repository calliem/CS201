People Consulted: Link office hour TA's on setting an empty constructor for LinkStrand so that the program would run properly along with questions on the analysis portion of the program

Hours worked = ~20

The instructions for this assignment's analysis portion were a little difficult to understand but were not too difficult once sorted through. I felt like the LinkStrand reverse method was one of the more difficult portions to code and really tested my knowledge of linkedlists and objects and was perhaps the most beneficial to me. The extra credit was also a great way to incorporate other data structures that we had learned and I enjoyed the coding parts of this assignment.
