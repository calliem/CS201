The instructions for the coding parts of this assignment were fairly clear and the walkthrough greatly clarified any ambiguity. This part of the assignment was extremely fun to write and work through and I enjoyed it a lot. The analysis instructions were a little harder to understand and would be a little easier to understand if it were divided into 2/3 questions/parts for each thing it wanted to have analyzed.
