Hours worked: ~20 hours

Students consulted: I consulted a TA during Link Help Hours about problems in my code, specifically incorrectly using myMap instead of map in a portion of my code. Additionally, I consulted a TA to clarify instructions about the WordMarkovModel class and about the analysis portion of the assignment.
Resources used: none

I had trouble on this assignment understanding the instructions of what to do and how to approach it. The recitation helped greatly in comprehending and getting started on the assignment. Overall, this assignment was much more difficult than the previous two, possibly because of the new concepts that were introduced for the first time in a full-fledged program. Regardless, I greatly enjoyed coding this assignment and feel like I am now much more comfortable with how object-oriented programming works and the importance of runtime and efficiency.
